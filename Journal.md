Reflection (1st day) -
-----------------
#### What did we do today:
1. We wrote a program in the Arduino for the first time.
1. We made make a circuit.

#### What did you learn:
1. How a few functions work (PinMode, digitalWriter and delay)
1. Where and how to connect the cables and other components of the circuit in the breadboard.

#### Homework:
1. What is the meaning of void?
ans: it's a variable used only in function declarations that indicates that the function is expected to return no information to the 
function from which it was called. (source: https://www.arduino.cc/reference/tr/language/variables/data-types/void).
1. What are the types of variables?

Reflection (2nd day)
-----------------------------
#### What did we do today:
1. warm up- converting types of data representations
1. Correction of homework - ways to write code and evaluation
1. Binary logic (and, or, xor, not, nand, nor)

#### What did you learn:
1. The symbols of binary logic
1.How to count in different bases
1. How to use binary logic to find the pattern in a table

#### Homework:
1. Solve the hw tables again but using binary logic

Reflection (2nd day)
-----------------------------
#### What did we do today:
1. Solve a sheet about binary logic


#### What did you learn:
1. Got a better understanding on how to do and interpret logic tables

#### Questions:
1. I tried doing the tables hw again using boolean but its not working 
1. I still need to pratice counting in different bases


Reflection (3rd day)
-----------------------------
#### What did we do today:
1. Solving ib exams type of questions
1. warm up activity: do a program that lights up lcds in order to form numbers from 0 to 7 by using a logic table and logic equations.

#### What did you learn:
1. it was a good practise to improve my undertanding on logic tables

#### Homework:
1. Finish the program
