Reflection (1st day) -
-----------------
#### What did we do today:
1. We wrote a program in the Arduino for the first time.
1. We made make a circuit.

#### What did you learn:
1. How a few functions work (PinMode, digitalWriter and delay)
1. Where and how to connect the cables and other components of the circuit in the breadboard.

#### Homework:
1. What is the meaning of void?
ans: it's a variable used only in function declarations that indicates that the function is expected to return no information to the 
function from which it was called. (https://www.arduino.cc/reference/tr/language/variables/data-types/void).
