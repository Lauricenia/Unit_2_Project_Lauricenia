Reflection (1st day) -
-----------------
#### What did we do today:
1. We wrote a program in the Arduino for the first time.
1. We made make a circuit.

#### What did you learn:
1. How a few functions work (PinMode, digitalWriter and delay)
1. Where and how to connect the cables and other components of the circuit in the breadboard.

#### Homework:
1. What is the meaning of void?
ans: it's a variable used only in function declarations that indicates that the function is expected to return no information to the 
function from which it was called. (source: https://www.arduino.cc/reference/tr/language/variables/data-types/void).
1. What are the types of variables?

Reflection (7th day) - 25th November
-----------------------------
#### What did we do today:
1. What is usability?

```
In software engineering, usability is the degree to which a software can be used by specified consumers to achieve quantified objectives with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction in a quantified context of use. 
```
```
[“Usability.” Usability - Computer Science Wiki, computersciencewiki.org/index.php/Usability.]
```
1. Human-centered design HCD

```
