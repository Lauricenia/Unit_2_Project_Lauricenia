  Definition of the problem
  ================
  My client,the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is a U.S. government agency that is responsible for science and technology related to air and space[1]. The agency launched a competition among the most famous programmers to create a communication system between Earth and Mars, and the Moon and Mars. The requirements outlined by the agency was that the system must allow the stations to communicate seamlessly using English, the keyboard input on each station must be limited to 2 push buttons and only 100W lights buzzers can't be available. The current technology limitates the Earth station to communicate in Morse and the Moon station to communicate in binary.
